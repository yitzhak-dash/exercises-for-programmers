# 1. Saying Hello
The “Hello, World” program is the first program you learn
to write in many languages, but it doesn’t involve any input.
So create a program that prompts for your name and prints
a greeting using your name.
#### Example Output
    What is your name? Brian
    Hello, Brian, nice to meet you!
#### Constraint
* Keep the input, string concatenation, and output separate.
#### Challenges
* Write a new version of the program without using any
variables.
* Write a version of the program that displays different
greetings for different people. This would be a good
challenge to try after you’ve completed the exercises in
`Chapter 4, Making Decisions, on page 29 and Chapter 7,
Data Structures, on page 63`.
